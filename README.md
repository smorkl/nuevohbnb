# New HBnB V2

This project is a simulation of a rental platform similar to HBnB. In this application, users can:
- Create and manage accounts.
- Create and list amenities.
- Create places.
- Leave reviews for the places they visit.

Data is stored in a database using **SQLAlchemy**, which supports CRUD operations to save and manage users, amenities, places, and reviews.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:smorkl/holbertonschool-hbnb.git
    cd part2
    cd HBnB
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure your database environment variables (if applicable) in the `config.py` file.

## Entities
- **User**: Represents a platform user.
- **Responsibilities**: Create and manage users, handle authentication information.
- **Example Methods**:
- `User.get_user_by_email(email)`: Retrieves a user by their email address.

- **Place**: Represents a property or accommodation available on the platform.
- **Responsibilities**: Define key information about the property, such as location, price, and amenities.
- **Example Methods**:
- `Place.add(place_data)`: Adds a new place to the database.
- `Place.get(place_id)`: Retrieves a place by its ID.

- **Review**: Represents a review made by a user about a place.
- **Responsibilities**: Allow users to leave comments and rate places.
- **Example Methods**:
- `Review.add(review_data)`: Adds a new review to a specific place.

- **Amenity**: Represents a service or feature that a place can offer.
- **Responsibilities**: Describe the services available at a place.
- **Example Methods**:
- `Amenity.add(amenity_data)`: Adds a new amenity to the database.

## Usage

To run the project, open a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

## Project Architecture

The project follows a three-layer architecture pattern, which helps keep the code organized, scalable, and modular:

- **Presentation Layer (API)**: Manages HTTP requests and responses.
- **Business Logic Layer (Services)**: Handles business logic and coordinates operations between models.
- **Persistence Layer (Repository)**: Interacts with the database to perform storage and retrieval operations.
